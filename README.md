# HH_IconPack
An overhaul of every single item that comes with QBCore by default + more!

P.S. If you would like a custom icon made, DM me on discord Hunter#1243. I will not charge you, I just think a more uniform look will benefit the community as a whole!

## Installation
- drag images from HH_IconPack into the images folder of your inventory :)


## Dependencies
- [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
- Inventory script of your choice (most likely [qb-inventory](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-inventory) or [aj-inventory](https://github.com/ihyajb/aj-inventory))
